#Assignment 1

The experiment using WebGL that I found interesting was [Museum of the World](https://britishmuseum.withgoogle.com/) from the British Museum. The graphic is a fun way to view history and I especially like that it isn't just a for fun graphic, but is a way to conceptualize a timeline through different artifacts with their descriptions and pictures. The site also uses sound to make scrolling more interactive and overall tries to make history more interesting through the use of color and sound.
